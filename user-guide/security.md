# Security: Encryption and Authentication

Encryption like Transport-Level Security (TLS) and authentication at the edge of systems is essential with the current threat landscape, although implementing them can be non-trivial. Ambassador Edge Stack enables easy configuration of TLS termination, certificate rotation and associated Kubernetes configuration.

Ambassador Edge Stack also supports a range of authentication implementations, with a simple demonstration service provided within the Ambassador Open Source, and a more comprehensive OAuth/OIDC Authentication service provided within Ambassador Edge Stack.

Ambassador OSS is an open source Kubernetes-native API Gateway. 
We recommend upgrading to [Ambassador Edge Stack](/user-guide/upgrade-from-oss-to-edge-stack) 
Community, which is available for free and limited use, along 
with additional functionality around security and developer onboarding.
