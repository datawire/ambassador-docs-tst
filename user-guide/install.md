# Installation Overview

Ambassador Edge Stack can be installed in a variety of ways. The most common approach to installing Ambassador Edge Stack is directly on Kubernetes with our default, customizable manifest.

* Install with [Kubernetes via YAML](/user-guide/getting-started)
* Install with [Kubernetes Helm](/user-guide/helm)
* Install with [Kubernetes Bare Metal](/user-guide/bare-metal)
* Install with [Docker's Quick Start](/user-guide/quickstart) Method
* Install with [Docker Compose](/user-guide/docker-compose)
