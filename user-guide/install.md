# Installation Overview

Ambassador Edge Stack can be installed in a variety of ways. The most common approach to installing Ambassador Edge Stack is directly on Kubernetes with our default, customizable manifest via a [YAML file](/user-guide/getting-started).


## Other Install Options

If you already have an existing edition of Ambassador and would like to upgrade, see the pages in **Other Install & Upgrade Options** category.

These include upgrading from the **Ambassador API Gateway to Edge Stack**, upgrading from **Ambassador Pro to Edge Stack** and installing the [Ambassador API Gateway](/user-guide/install-ambassador-oss).
